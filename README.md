# Homecoming-Project

We were told to make a read me file, telling us what we do each day and what are goals were of that day.

We are also suppose to give our peers an evaluation.

On day one we were told to set our fireframe and make sure that we have a plan for our website. That was exactly what we did.


Evaluation


Tyler: Was a great partner, and was the life of the group. He Helped pick out colors and made sure that we had fun while doing our project.

Matthew: The master coder of the group, he knows a lot more than me and tyler at code, so thats what he was in charge of.

Myself: I was the master at adding images. I know most of the ends and outs of images, so that was my priotity.
